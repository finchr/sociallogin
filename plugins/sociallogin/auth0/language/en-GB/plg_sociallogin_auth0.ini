PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0="Akeeba Social Login - Auth0 SSO integration"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_DESCRIPTION="Allows logging into your site using the Single Sign-On (SSO) service provided by Auth0 NAS devices and Auth0 DSM virtual machine instances."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_DOMAINN_LABEL="Domain URL"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_DOMAINN_DESC="You can find this in your Auth0 Application Domain. Add 'https://'."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_LOGIN_LABEL="Sign in with Auth0 SSO"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_LOGIN_DESC="Login with your Auth0 Single Sign-On account. A new account will be created if no matching account exists on our site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_LINK_LABEL="Link Auth0 SSO"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site with Auth0 SSO. You can then log into this site using Auth0 SSO."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink Auth0 SSO"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user account on this site from your Auth0 SSO account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="Application ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_APPID_DESC="Enter the Application ID. You can create a new application and get this information by logging into Auth0 DSM and going to SSO Server, Application."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_APPSECRET_LABEL="Application Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_APPSECRET_DESC="Enter the Application Secret. You can create a new application and get this information by logging into Auth0 DSM and going to SSO Server, Application."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_LABEL="Allow social login to non-linked accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC="When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their Auth0 SSO account to their site user account. Their Auth0 SSO account's email address must be the same as the email account they use on your site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Auth0 SSO but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Auth0 SSO username. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have the same username as the Auth0 SSO account, the same email address as the Auth0 SSO account, a name in the form “Auth0 SSO User some_username”, and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Auth0 SSO login."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a Auth0 SSO account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL="Bypass user validation for Auth0 SSO users"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC="Only applies when creating new user accounts. When this option is enabled, the new Joomla! user will be created active, without going through the Joomla! user account validation. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site. This is safe because Auth0 SSO accounts are manually validated by the administrators of the Auth0 DSM instance you are using."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AUTH0_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."
